The Audiological and Genetic Database (AudGenDB) is a **medical and research database** resource that **supports qualified researchers studying pediatric hearing health**. The database draws information from several sources, including electronic health records, audiological instruments, radiological imagery, and clinical genetics results, and makes them accessible to researchers on this site after gaining approval. We are currently working with the coordinating IRB to establish the procedure for approval. Please refer questions to [John Germiller, MD, PhD](mailto:germiller@email.chop.edu).
